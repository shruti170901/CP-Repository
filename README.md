## For CP CLRS can be considered as a good reference book 
for algorithms. Topcoder Tutorials should be read thoroughly and 
the mentioned problems should be solved. Upsolving plays a major 
role for understanding new concepts. Theory for Types and Data Structures,
Algorithms, Programming Languages Fundamentals, Cryptography and Simulations
 and Machine Learning can be read from https://brilliant.org/computer-science/ .
 https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Competitive_Programming has to be followed line 
 by line. Relevant sections from https://github.com/wncc/CodeInQuarantine/tree/master/Week_2_CC can (read must) also be covered.
